# Prediction Methodology and Model Performance

The predictions integrated into the BacDive website were generated using a GenomeNet model trained with the [deepG](https://deepg.de/) package in R.

## Model Performance by Task
The table below summarizes the model's performance across various phenotype prediction tasks. Performance is measured using **balanced accuracy**, which accounts for class imbalance by averaging recall across all classes. A balanced accuracy of 50% indicates random performance, while higher values indicate better predictive ability.

| Phenotype/Task           | Classification Type       | Classes                                      | Balanced Accuracy (%) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Spore Formation          | Binary Classification     | [TRUE, FALSE]                                | 91%                   |
| Oxygen Growth            | Binary Classification     | [aerobe, anaerobe]                           | 87%                   |
| Oxygen (obligate)        | Binary Classification     | [aerobe, anaerobe]                           | 85%                   |
| Oxygen (microaerophile)  | Binary Classification     | [aerobe, anaerobe]                           | 82%                   |
| Oxygen (facultative)     | Binary Classification     | [aerobe, anaerobe]                           | 72%                   |
| Motility                 | Binary Classification     | [TRUE, FALSE]                                | 74%                   |
| Gram Staining            | Multiclass Classification | [negative, positive, variable]               | 85%                   |
| Biosafety Level (BSL)    | Multiclass Classification | [Risk Group 1, Risk Group 2, Risk Group 3]   | 40%                   |


## Confidence of Predictions
In a two-class classification setting, the model outputs a **probability value** $P_{class}$ between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the instance belonging to class 1, with the complementary probability $1-P_{class}$ assigned to class 2. 
While this is technically a class probability rather than a *confidence* measure in the frequentist or Bayesian sense, it is often informally referred to as *confidence* in applied machine learning to indicate the modelâ€™s assigned probability to its most probable class. In this case, a value close to 1 suggests strong model support for class 1, a value close to 0 suggests strong support for the other class, and a value near 0.5 indicates that the model has little preference between the classes, meaning the prediction is less informative.

### **Binary Classification**
For binary tasks, the model provides class probabilities that are directly used to estimate prediction *confidence*.

### **Multi-Class Classification**
In multi-class classification, raw probabilities can be misleading, especially with more classes, where probabilities naturally decrease. Scaling adjusts for this by normalizing probabilities relative to the number of classes and applying logarithmic scaling to avoid *"overconfidence"* for smaller probabilities. This ensures *confidence* scores are intuitive, with values close to 1 indicating high *confidence* and values near 0 reflecting low confidence. The *confidence* value for a class probability $P_{class}$ and number of classes $N_{classes}$ is calculated using the following formula: 
<p align="center">
$$\text{Confidence}(P_{class}) = 0.5 + 0.5 \frac{\ln(N_{classes} \times P_{class})}{\ln(N_{classes})}$$
</p>

### **Threshold-Based Prediction**
For biosafety level prediction, the model's output $y$ is mapped to discrete levels (1, 2, or 3) based on thresholds. *Confidence* is computed based on the distance from these thresholds, ensuring high *confidence* near extremes and intuitive scaling within the range.
  - If $y < 1.15$, the prediction is Level 1, with *confidence* increasing as $y$ moves further below the threshold.
  - If $y > 2.1$, the prediction is Level 3, with *confidence* increasing as $y$ moves further above the threshold. 
  - For $1.15 \leq y \leq 2.1$, the prediction is Level 2, with *confidence* being computed using a normalized distance from the range center:
<p align="center">
$$\text{Confidence}(P_{class}) = 1 - \frac{|y - 1.625|}{(2.1 - 1.15) / 2}$$
</p>

where $\text{mean}(2.1, 1.15) = 1.625$ is the center of the range.

This method ensures *confidence* scores are intuitive, with values closer to 1 indicating predictions near the thresholds or the range center, while those farther away approach 0.
